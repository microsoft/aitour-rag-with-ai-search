# Session delivery resources

The following resources are intended for a presenter to learn and deliver the session.

We're glad you are here and look forward to your delivery of this amazing content. As an experienced presenter, we know you know HOW to present so this guide will focus on WHAT you need to present. It will provide you a full run-through of the presentation created by the presentation design team. 

Along with the video of the presentation, this document will link to all the assets you need to successfully present including PowerPoint slides and demo instructions & code.

## Demos

These are the demos that you may choose to do in the presentation. You may leave some out depending on time constraints. 

### Setup

To be able to show the demos yourself, setup these three repositories:

* **RAG on PostgreSQL**: Follow instructions in [rag-postgres-openai-python](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/rag-postgres-openai-python)
* **RAG on AI Search**: Follow deployment instructions in [azure-search-openai-demo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo), making sure to enable [the optional vision feature](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo/blob/main/docs/gpt4v.md)
* **Python Notebooks**: Follow instructions in [rag-with-azure-ai-search-notebooks](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/rag-with-azure-ai-search-notebooks). Note that this repo assumes you've already setup azure-search-openai-demo.

### Transcript

A suggested transcript for each is [available](https://aka.ms/AArw0cd).

### Video recordings

If you'd like, there are videos available for each demo. You can either narrate the silent version of the video, or play the video with audio.
